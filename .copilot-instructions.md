# Home Assistant Blueprint Development Guidelines

You are an expert Home Assistant Blueprint developer focused on creating high-quality, consistent, and community-standard compliant blueprints. Follow these comprehensive guidelines when creating or modifying Home Assistant Blueprints.

## Core Principles

1. **Validity**: All blueprints must be valid YAML that conform to the official Home Assistant Blueprint schema
2. **Consistency**: Maintain uniform structure, naming, and formatting across all blueprints
3. **Usability**: Prioritize user experience with clear descriptions, appropriate selectors, and sensible defaults
4. **Community Standards**: Follow established Home Assistant community best practices and conventions

## Blueprint Schema Requirements

### Required Metadata
Every blueprint MUST include:
```yaml
blueprint:
  name: "Short, Descriptive Name"
  domain: automation|script|template
```

### Highly Recommended Metadata
Always include these fields for better user experience:
```yaml
blueprint:
  name: "Motion-Activated Light Control"
  description: |
    Turn on lights when motion is detected and turn them off after a specified delay.
    
    **Features:**
    - Configurable motion sensor
    - Customizable light targets
    - Adjustable delay timer
    - Optional illuminance threshold
  domain: automation
  author: "Your Name"
  homeassistant:
    min_version: "2024.6.0"
```

## Blueprint Structure Standards

### 1. Metadata Order
Always organize metadata in this order:
1. `name` (required)
2. `description` (highly recommended)
3. `domain` (required)
4. `author` (recommended)
5. `homeassistant.min_version` (recommended)
6. `input` (if applicable)

### 2. Input Organization
- Group related inputs using sections (requires min_version: 2024.6.0+)
- Order inputs logically: triggers → conditions → actions → settings
- Use descriptive input keys with snake_case naming

```yaml
input:
  # Main Configuration Section
  main_config:
    name: "Main Configuration"
    icon: "mdi:cog"
    description: "Primary settings for this automation"
    input:
      motion_sensor:
        name: "Motion Sensor"
        description: "The motion sensor that will trigger this automation"
        selector:
          entity:
            filter:
              domain: binary_sensor
              device_class: motion
      
      light_target:
        name: "Light"
        description: "Light(s) to control"
        selector:
          target:
            entity:
              domain: light
  
  # Advanced Settings Section (collapsed by default)
  advanced_settings:
    name: "Advanced Settings"
    icon: "mdi:tune"
    description: "Optional advanced configuration"
    collapsed: true
    input:
      delay_time:
        name: "Delay Time"
        description: "Time to wait before turning off lights after motion stops"
        default: 120
        selector:
          number:
            min: 0
            max: 3600
            unit_of_measurement: "seconds"
```

## Input Best Practices

### 1. Selector Usage
Always use appropriate selectors for better UX:

```yaml
# Entity selectors with filters
motion_sensor:
  selector:
    entity:
      filter:
        domain: binary_sensor
        device_class: motion

# Target selectors for multiple entities
light_targets:
  selector:
    target:
      entity:
        domain: light

# Number selectors with constraints
delay_minutes:
  selector:
    number:
      min: 1
      max: 60
      unit_of_measurement: "minutes"
      mode: slider

# Boolean selectors for toggles
enable_feature:
  selector:
    boolean:

# Select selectors for predefined options
automation_mode:
  selector:
    select:
      options:
        - "single"
        - "restart"
        - "queued"
        - "parallel"
```

### 2. Default Values
- Always provide sensible defaults for optional inputs
- Use defaults that work for most common use cases
- Ensure collapsed sections have defaults for all inputs

### 3. Input Descriptions
- Be concise but descriptive
- Explain what the input does and any constraints
- Use proper grammar and punctuation
- Support Markdown formatting where helpful

## Naming Conventions

### Blueprint Names
- Use title case: "Motion-Activated Light Control"
- Be specific and descriptive
- Keep under 50 characters
- Avoid generic terms like "Automation" or "Blueprint"

### Input Keys
- Use snake_case: `motion_sensor`, `delay_time`, `enable_notifications`
- Be descriptive and unambiguous
- Group related inputs with common prefixes: `light_entity`, `light_brightness`

### File Names
- Use kebab-case: `motion-activated-light.yaml`
- Match the blueprint functionality
- Include domain if not obvious: `security-camera-motion-script.yaml`

## YAML Standards

### 1. Formatting
- Use 2-space indentation consistently
- Include proper spacing around colons: `key: value`
- Use double quotes for strings containing special characters
- Use literal block scalars (`|`) for multi-line descriptions

### 2. Comments
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Document any non-obvious template usage
- Explain conditional sections

```yaml
# Turn off lights only if they were turned on by this automation
- if:
    - condition: template
      value_template: "{{ trigger.to_state.context.parent_id == this.context.id }}"
  then:
    - service: light.turn_off
      target: !input light_target
```

## Template Usage

### 1. Input References
- Use `!input input_name` syntax for referencing inputs
- Expose inputs as variables when using in templates:

```yaml
variables:
  motion_entity: !input motion_sensor
  delay_seconds: !input delay_time
```

### 2. Template Validation
- Always validate template syntax
- Handle edge cases and potential null values
- Use `is_state()` and `states()` functions appropriately

## Automation-Specific Guidelines

### 1. Trigger Structure
```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: !input motion_sensor
    from: "off"
    to: "on"
  - platform: state
    entity_id: !input motion_sensor
    from: "on"
    to: "off"
    for: !input delay_time
```

### 2. Condition Usage
- Use conditions to prevent unwanted executions
- Add time-based conditions when appropriate
- Include state validations

### 3. Action Organization
- Use descriptive action comments
- Group related actions in sequences
- Implement proper error handling

## Script-Specific Guidelines

### 1. Mode Configuration
```yaml
mode: restart  # or single, queued, parallel
max_exceeded: warning
```

### 2. Field Definitions
- Always define script fields for inputs
- Use appropriate field types and descriptions

```yaml
fields:
  target_lights:
    description: "Lights to control"
    required: true
    selector:
      target:
        entity:
          domain: light
```

## Version Compatibility

### Minimum Version Guidelines
- Set `min_version` to the lowest compatible HA version
- Use 2024.6.0+ for input sections
- Use 2024.1.0+ for modern selector types
- Update when using newer features

### Feature Deprecation
- Avoid deprecated features and syntax
- Use current best practices
- Document migration paths in descriptions

## Documentation Standards

### Description Format
```yaml
description: |
  Brief one-line summary of what the blueprint does.
  
  **Features:**
  - Feature 1 with explanation
  - Feature 2 with explanation
  - Feature 3 with explanation
  
  **Requirements:**
  - Required integration or setup
  
  **Usage Notes:**
  - Important usage information
  - Configuration tips
```

### Input Documentation
- Explain what each input controls
- Document valid values or ranges
- Note any dependencies between inputs

## Error Prevention

### Common Issues to Avoid
1. Missing required metadata fields
2. Invalid YAML syntax or indentation
3. Incorrect selector configurations
4. Missing default values for collapsed inputs
5. Incompatible minimum version requirements
6. Circular references in templates
7. Missing entity validations
