    Comprehensive water leak monitoring and valve control for Moen Flo smart water system with 
    intelligent alerts and automatic valve control capabilities.
    
    **Features:**
    - Water leak detection with immediate notifications
    - Automatic valve shutdown on critical leaks
    - Water pressure monitoring with configurable thresholds
    - Water flow rate monitoring for unusual usage patterns
    - Valve control actions with safety confirmations
    - Low battery alerts for wireless sensors
    - Configurable notification services and escalation
    
    **Alert Types:**
    - **Critical Leak**: Immediate notification + optional automatic valve shutdown
    - **Water Flow**: Unusual flow patterns or continuous flow detection
    - **Pressure Issues**: High/low water pressure alerts
    - **Battery Low**: Low battery alerts for wireless components
    - **Valve Status**: Valve open/closed status changes
    
    **Safety Features:**
    - Manual valve control override protection
    - Configurable auto-shutoff delays to prevent false triggers
    - Recovery notifications when issues resolve
    - Multiple notification services support
    
    **Requirements:**
    - Moen Flo smart water system integration in Home Assistant
    - Configured notification services
    - Proper Moen Flo device entities available
    
    **Usage Notes:**
    - Configure leak detection sensors for immediate response
    - Set appropriate pressure thresholds for your home's plumbing
    - Test valve control functionality before relying on auto-shutoff
    - Critical alerts will repeat until manually acknowledged or resolved

                • Consider installing/adjusting pressure reducing valve
                • Inspect for water hammer issues
                • Contact plumber if pressure consistently high
